# Travel-List
- A simple react app that makes you a list of what you want to pack for a travel.
- You can add as many as items you want, mark item as packed, delete specific item or all items, and order items.
- This app wasn't focused on css but more on react fundamentals.
### React Fundamentals covered:
- Props
- Rendering lists using JavaScript array methods
- Conditional rendering
- React State
- Controlled elements
- Lifting up the state concept
- Derived state
- Reusable components
